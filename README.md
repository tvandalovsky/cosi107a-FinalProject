## Project Description

This project is an implementation of SQL injection in Python. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a poorly designed application which uses SQL as its database managment system is vulnerable to cyber attacks and can have unwanted data extraction and manipulation.

The dependences you need to run the apps on your own machine can be seen in the Makefile under dependences make target.

* [ ] get sql injections to work in unsafe enviornment

  * [ ] automate sql operations to populate unsafe_db
